Nominal wage changes are found to occur at a quarterly frequency of around 38 percent over our sample period, and to be to a large extent staggered across establishments, and very synchronized within establishments. We carry out an econometric analysis of wage changes based on a two-threshold sample selection model. Our results are that the timing of wage adjustments is time-dependent as opposed to state-dependent, there is evidence of predetermination in wage changes, and both backward and forward-looking behavior is relevant in wage setting.},

	abstract = {US economy is facing inflation jump, which is running at 30 year high. Using inequality and inflation data that are available at a high frequency, i.e. on a quarterly basis for over 30 years, we find evidence that inflation causes swings in income distribution rapidly. The dynamic response of inequality to changes in inflation alters over a fourquarter period. We show that the contemporaneous impact of inflation on inequality is negative; however, after three quarters the impact becomes positive and stronger in magnitude. From our results we learn that over a one year period, higher inflation would exacerbate income inequality in USA. The positive impact of inflation on income inequality is stronger when inflation rate, initially, is above the sample average.},

	abstract = {Previous work on the politics of monetary policy has focused on the role of distributive motives stemming from individual characteristics such as income or factoral/sectoral interests in citizens' formation of monetary policy preferences. However, the existing literature has paid little attention to how a country's overall distributive context, namely, its level of economic inequality, affects citizens' preferences vis-à-vis price stability and employment. This article argues that as inequality pushes more citizens below a society's average income, there is more demand for redistribution through higher employment and increased fiscal spending, each of which can be better supported by expansionary monetary policy. This means that inequality makes citizens more tolerant of inflation. This study uses the International Social Survey Program, the Integrated Values Surveys, and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, which together include 293,100 respondents from 53 countries between the years 1976 and 2016 to demonstrate that overall, inequality significantly moderates citizens' inflation aversion.},

But for some economic agents, violation of laws and rules offers easier ways to earn income and wealth. The agents of law-enforcing authority may also patronize such violation, out of sheer greed. This process brings turmoil in the system and the authority tries to manage this tendency by following easy money policy. The outcome is asset price inflation and inequality of income and wealth. Gradually the system becomes vulnerable to economic, social and political crisis.This paper argues that one possible way to manage the asset price inflation without hurting the real economic growth is to introduce a separate currency for asset transactions. This helps in tracking asset price inflation better and gives the central bank an additional instrument to address macroeconomic problem of inequality and asset price bubble.},

This paper investigates how central banks should react to household inflation heterogeneity in a tractable New Keynesian model. We include two households that differ in their consumer price inflation rates after adverse shocks. The central bank reacts to either an average of the households' consumer price inflation rates or their individual rates, respectively. After a negative demand shock, the consumer price inflation rates of both households diverge less from their steady states when the central bank only considers the individual inflation rate of the household experiencing the higher inflation rate. Furthermore, output fluctuates less under that regime. After a negative supply shock, a central bank only considering the household experiencing the higher inflation rate mitigates the immediate effects of the shock on both consumer price inflation rates more effectively. Our results imply that central banks, which react discretionarily to differing inflation experiences in an economy, lead to a more efficient attainment of an economy-wide inflation target and to lower fluctuations of all inflation rates.},

Due to different consumption bundles, middle-income households experience higher median inﬂation rates, which at the same time are more reactive to a contractionary monetary policy shock, leading to an overall convergence of inﬂation rates between income groups.

Over the period 2001–15, the consumption bundles of the poorest deciles in 25 European countries have, on average, become 11.2 percentage points more expensive than those of the richest deciles. We find that ignoring the differential inflation across the distribution underestimates the change in the Gini (based on consumption expenditure) by almost up to 0.04 points. Cross-country heterogeneity in this change is large enough to alter the inequality ranking of numerous countries. The average inflation effect we detect is almost as large as the change in the standard Gini measure over the period of interest.},

By comparing Plutocratic and Democratic indexes, and inflation between groups of income, we conclude that households experienced different inflation rates, with the poorer suffering more with the loss in the purchasing power.   The potential impacts of these findings on Fiscal and Monetary Policy show that around 1.77 million households could be paying federal income taxes when they should not; Social Security benefits could be up to 9.70\% higher for some households; Federal Funds Rates would be 0.8 percentage points higher, based on a Taylor type rule, if FED used a Democratic core inflation index.},

I present a mechanism where adverse macroeconomic shocks cause households to shift expenditure away from luxuries toward necessities, which leads to higher relative prices for necessities. I embed this mechanism into a quantitative model which explains around half of the cyclical variation in necessity prices and shares. The results suggest that low-income households are hit twice by recessions: once by the recession itself and again as their price index increases relative to other households.},

Using scanner data and the Consumer Expenditure Survey, I construct novel measures of household-level inflation and show that households experience inflation at very different rates. An increase in a household’s personal inflation rate leads to a persistent increase in their price index. Households respond to a personal inflation shock by decreasing nominal consumption, which means that real consumption falls more than one-for-one; poor households are least able to smooth their consumption in response to household inflation shocks. I find that inflation dispersion (the variance of household inflation rates) increases with the level of absolute aggregate inflation.

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Inflation in the euro area reached 5\% in December 2021, the highest level since the creation of the common currency. In some countries, the rise has been even more acute. In Belgium, inflation hit 6.5\%. However, in Italy and France the rise has been more moderate reaching 3.9\% and 3.4\% respectively (Figure 1).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rising inflation has mainly been driven by big increases in energy prices (electricity, gas and other fuels) since the start of 2021. The increase for energy was 23\% in December 2021 compared to December 2020. But, similarly to headline inflation, the energy price rise faced by consumers has been very different across the euro area. Year-on-year growth for electricity, gas and other fuels reached 60\% in Belgium, 33\% in Italy, and ‘only’ 19\% in France (Figure 2).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rising priced have triggered {\textless}a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-12-18/from-europe-to-the-americas-people-are-pressuring-governments-to-act-on-inflation"{\textgreater}demonstrations{\textless}/a{\textgreater} in many countries as vulnerable groups suffer from inflation and ask governments to adopt measures to shield them. In this context, it is crucial to understand who is affected most.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Inflation can have distributional effects for many reasons. Even if temporary, higher inflation usually weighs more on the poorest who lack savings to smooth their consumption over time. In addition, the savings they do have are often held in cash or in very low interest rate bank accounts with that are not shielded from inflation (while richer segments of the population often hold stocks or inflation-linked bonds, for instance). The lower bargaining power of low-income/low-skilled workers can also lead to lower real wages if inflation outpaces pay rises.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Individuals may also face different inflation rates if their consumption patterns are different. For example, in the euro area in 2021, the prices of domestic flights increased by 8.4\% but international flights by 3.7\% only. The price of newspapers increased by 4.3\%, while magazines only by 2.6\%. Thus, the specific structure of a household’s consumption basket determines the inflation rate it faces. These differences in consumption patterns can determine whether low-income households face a higher inflation rate than high-income households.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Inflation is higher for low-income households{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}It is impossible with the usual inflation data to answer the question of which groups are most affected by inflation because national statistical institutes and Eurostat’s headline inflation numbers – using the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) – only track the price of the average consumer basket (based on total consumer expenditure). We therefore use {\textless}a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/household-budget-surveys"{\textgreater}Household Budget Surveys{\textless}/a{\textgreater} (HBS) – national-level surveys on consumer expenditure with information on households (income level, education level, age of person of reference, number of children, etc.) – to compute the inflation rates faced by individuals with different characteristics (see the Annex for more details on the HBS and our methodology).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}For data availability reasons, we focus on three countries: Belgium, Italy and France, which are major euro-area economies that have faced different levels of both overall inflation and energy price growth. Belgium and Italy publish HBS results quite frequently (every two years and every year, respectively) and at a quite granular level. France unfortunately does not publish its results as frequently, but remains interesting given the different dynamics in inflation and energy prices (see annex).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}In all three countries, the actual rate of inflation faced by the lowest income categories (lowest-earning fifth of households in Italy and France, lowest-earning quarter in Belgium) is currently higher than the rate of inflation of the highest income categories (Figure 3). However, the magnitude of this difference varies significantly. In December 2021, the inflation rates faced by low-income individuals were 1.4, 1.7 and 0.3 percentage points higher than that faced by high-income individuals in Belgium, Italy and France, respectively. Conversely, inflation experienced by low-income individuals was lower than that faced by high-income individuals in Italy and Belgium throughout 2020, while this was not the case in France.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Energy prices are driving the current surge in inflation inequality{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Broadly speaking, inflation inequality (the fact that inflation is different for low- and high-income households) can evolve for two reasons. First, changes in the inflation rates of particular consumption goods can drive inflation inequality, given that these goods have different weights in the consumption baskets of different groups. Second, behavioural changes in reaction to rising prices might differ from one group to another. For instance, if low-income households have a harder time smoothing their consumption given rising energy prices, the relative importance of energy in total expenditure will rise faster for low-income households, increasing inflation inequality. This second dynamic is harder to capture with the data (given that imputed weights are updated every other year in Belgium and do not change over the period of analysis for France, because of the frequency of the HBS).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Specific goods increase inflation inequality if their inflation rates are positive and their relative importance is greater in the consumption basket of low-income households (or if their inflation rates are negative and their relative importance smaller). For example, if a given good represents 20\% of total expenditure of low-income households and only 10\% of total expenditure of high-income households, and its inflation rate is 10\%, the good will increase inflation inequality by 1 percentage point (ie: (0.2-0.1)*0.1 = 0.01). If a good has the same weight for low- and high-earners, its inflation rate (however high) will have no impact on inflation inequality. We compute this effect for all goods, aggregate them across broad categories and report results in Figure 4.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}div class="infogram-embed" data-id="1pwejn17w9ezvrhvlzglylpw9wh96219ddw" data-type="interactive"{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}script{\textgreater}!function(e,t,s,i)\{var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script"),d=o[0],r=/{\textasciicircum}http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}/\{2\}/.test(i)\&\&(i=r+i),window[n]\&\&window[n].initialized)window[n].process\&\&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s))\{var a=e.createElement("script");a.async=1,a.id=s,a.src=i,d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)\}\}(document,0,"infogram-async","//e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");{\textless}/script{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Clearly, the recent surge in inflation inequality in Belgium and Italy has been driven mostly by the surge in energy prices. In France, where inflation inequality is much lower and has remained at around 0.3pp for the past three years, it is interesting to note that energy prices are nevertheless playing an increasingly large role in explaining differences in inflation rates at different income levels, suggesting that without the price increases in this sector, inflation inequality in France would be declining.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Part of these differences between France and Italy and Belgium can be explained by the lower volatility of energy prices in France (visible in Figure 2). This lower volatility results from the possibility for French households to opt for stickier {\textless}a href="https://www.energie-info.fr/fiche\_pratique/puis-je-revenir-au-tarif-reglemente-apres-avoir-souscrit-une-offre-de-marche/"{\textgreater}regulated prices{\textless}/a{\textgreater}. This means French households are less affected by short-term energy price increases, but also that they benefit less from energy price reductions, such as happened in 2020 (when the actual inflation rate was lower for low-income households in Belgium and Italy). In addition to explaining why inflation inequality did not increase dramatically in 2021 in France, this explains why it was not reversed like in Belgium or Italy in 2020, when poorer households benefited more from declining energy prices (as can be seen in Figure 3).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}The outsized role of energy in explaining growing inflation inequality in European countries is not so much driven by large differences in consumption, but by the staggering increase in gas and electricity prices for consumers, in particular in Belgium and Italy, meaning that a small difference in consumption shares can lead to large differences in inflation rates for different income levels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}The share of total household expenditure on energy is not very different for low-income and high-income households (Figure 5; the difference for house rentals is much higher in all countries). However, despite this, the growth rate of energy prices was so high in 2021 in Italy and even more in Belgium (consumer gas prices increased by 20\% and 40\%, respectively) that it has resulted in large increases in inflation inequality. Accordingly, the much lower growth rate of energy prices faced by households in France explains why inflation inequality is not rising there.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}The actual effect would be amplified if low-income households are forced to increase the share of their total expenditure that goes to energy (given the lesser ability of low-income households to smooth consumption and the need to sacrifice other types of consumption to continue heating homes and driving cars). Such behavioural responses are quite likely and would mean that the rise in inflation inequality is {\textless}a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2021/03/how-has-covid-19-affected-inflation-measurement-in-the-euro-area/"{\textgreater}underestimated{\textless}/a{\textgreater}. However, this is not visible in the metric that we use because, as with the HICP, we use weights from previous years and not contemporaneous weights (see annex), which could lead to minimising the inflation rate really felt by consumers (a problem we discussed in a previous {\textless}a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2021/03/how-has-covid-19-affected-inflation-measurement-in-the-euro-area/"{\textgreater}blog post{\textless}/a{\textgreater}).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Conclusions and recommendations{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Though inflation inequality is an important issue, the Household Budget Survey data, which enables us to compute inflation rates for different income groups, is too scarce. While some countries run the survey annually (or biennially) and publish granular data, most European countries do so only every five years, and often do not make precise data available (the granularity of the consumption goods reported enables a more precise computation of inflation rates for different income groups). Relying only on Eurostat’s harmonisation every five years makes it difficult to obtain a dynamic view of how behavioural changes are impacting real inflation across groups. Easy access to such data would be of great value to researchers, policymakers and central bankers, enabling a better understanding of the distributional effects of inflation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Despite the lack of good data, our analysis suggests clearly that low-income households are suffering disproportionately from the current rise in inflation. The steep rise in energy prices explains this. European countries have {\textless}a href="https://www.bruegel.org/publications/datasets/national-policies-to-shield-consumers-from-rising-energy-prices/"{\textgreater}introduced a variety of measures{\textless}/a{\textgreater} to try to shield consumers from the direct impact of rising energy prices. The differences in inflation inequality between France and Belgium suggest that the willingness, or ability, to achieve such goals varies significantly across countries. The French strategy to shield households appears to have had the intended effect, but measures since autumn have already cost a {\textless}a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2022/01/26/budget-bercy-a-deja-les-yeux-rives-sur-2027\_6111118\_823448.html"{\textgreater}staggering €15.5 billion{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, and there has been mounting controversy about the obligation for EDF to sell electricity at a fixed price to its competitors (with an {\textless}a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/industrie-services/energie-environnement/prix-de-lelectricite-edf-plonge-de-23-en-bourse-1379179"{\textgreater}estimated cost{\textless}/a{\textgreater} of €8 billion for the company). If the spike in energy prices is only temporary, the French approach could be viable solution. But given that long-term rises in the prices of fossil fuels will be needed for decarbonisation, countries need to start thinking about more efficient measures to mitigate the future, potentially much more persistent, impact of rising energy prices on inflation inequality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

This means that data on group-specific expenditure for the euro-area as a whole is only updated every five years, the last occurrence being in 2015 (while expenditure weights used in the HICP are adjusted yearly, see {\textless}a href="https://www.bruegel.org/2021/03/how-has-covid-19-affected-inflation-measurement-in-the-euro-area/"{\textgreater}here{\textless}/a{\textgreater} for details). We therefore focused on more recent country-level data to get a better sense of how recent trends in inflation are affecting low-income households differently.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}We used HBS data to compute the weights given to each consumption good in the overall HICP index. Belgium and Italy publish consumption data at the 4-digit COICOP (classification of individual consumption by purpose) level, which is the third subdivision of the main consumption categories, while France has data at the 3-digit COICOP level only. For Italy, the frequency and level of granularity allow us to mimic the original HICP method: weights computed for year {\textless}em{\textgreater}t{\textless}/em{\textgreater} are used to compute inflation rate in year {\textless}em{\textgreater}t+1{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. For Belgium, we had to use 2018 weights for 2019, and 2020 weights for 2020 and 2021. For France, we had to use the same weights (computed in 2017) over the entire 2019-2021 period. The lower frequency of French numbers is obviously problematic. Ideally, we would like to take into account recent behavioural changes during the pandemic period, which would give a more precise idea of inflation rates faced by different income quantiles.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
{\textless}p{\textgreater}Nevertheless, using Italy as an example, Table 1 suggests that while behavioural changes over the course of a couple of years have been significant, the difference (in percentage points) of the weights of the different consumption categories between low- and high-income households is much more stable (which is what interests us). This means that despite changes in overall consumption patterns, the impact on inflation inequality has not been that high, given that changes in consumption are often similar for different income groups. If this holds for France too, this means that using the same weights for the whole period is not too significant an issue.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

We estimate the demand system derived from the model using household-level data from the United States and India, as well as historical aggregate-level panel data for 39 countries during the postwar period. The estimated model parsimoniously accounts for the broad patterns of sectoral reallocation observed among rich, miracle, and developing economies. Our estimates support the presence of strong nonhomotheticity across time, income levels, and countries. We find that income effects account for the bulk of the within-country evolution of sectoral reallocation.},

Governments are net losers of deflation, while the household (HH) sector is a net winner in the EA as a whole. HHs in Belgium, Ireland, Malta, and Germany experience the biggest per capita gains, while HHs in Finland and Spain turn out to be net losers. Considerable heterogeneity exists also within the HH sector: relatively young middle class HHs are net losers of deflation, while older and richer HHs are winners. As a result, wealth inequality in the EA increases with unexpected deflation, although in some countries (Austria, Germany, and Malta) inequality decreases due to the presence of relatively few young borrowing HHs. We document that HHs’ inflation exposure varies systematically across countries, with HHs in high-inflation EA countries holding systematically lower nominal exposures.},

	abstract = {Inflation and redistribution. The potential income redistribution effects of inflation due to differing expenditure patterns of families at different income levels are examined. Consumer price indexes are presented for all families of two or more persons and all families and unattached individuals in thirteen income classes. A further division is made to establish separate CPIS for homeowners and tenants by income class. Finally, a simulation experiment is performed to assess the effects on the over-all CPIS of substituting away from food (by families in the highest income group) and of the inability to reduce food expenditures (by families in the lowest income group). /// Inflation et redistribution. Les habitudes de dépense des familles de différents niveaux de revenu peuvent peut-être servir à montrer que des conditions d'inflation ont des effets de redistribution notables. C'est ce que les auteurs examinent ici en trois étapes, avec des données de Statistique Canada. Ils réunissent d'abord un ensemble d'indices de prix s'appliquant aux familles de deux individus ou plus, à la totalité des familles et aux personnes seules. Ces groupes sont répartis en treize classes distinctes de revenu. Les indices semblent montrer jusqu'à un certain point la justesse de l'utilisation répandue des changements de l'indice des prix à la consommation dans les mécanismes d'indexation des revenus et des classes d'imposition. En effet, on n'y perçoit que peu de différences entre les évolutions relatives des prix par classes de revenu depuis 1961. La plus grande partie des différences s'est produite après janvier 1971, alors que les changements des prix des aliments ont précédé l'accélération rapide des modifications des prix de plusieurs biens de consommation. Dans une deuxième étape, les indices par classes de revenu sont repris dans une version dichotomique où l'on distingue, de façon approximative, locataires et propriétaires. La chose est rendue possible par l'isolation de la composante de l'indice des prix à la consommation relative à l'habitation. Cet exercise simple produit une plus grande variabilité des indices. Cela peut signifier le besoin d'une réévaluation du fondement de cette composante. Enfin, les auteurs font une simulation pour essayer de voir les effets possibles d'une substitution sous la forme d'une réduction des dépenses de nourriture dans les classes à revenu élevé, et d'une impossibilité pour les familles à faibles revenus de réduire ces dépenses. Une telle asymétrie fait voir la possibilité d'un accroissement sensible du fardeau de l'inflation pour ce dernier groupe. On ne doit pas chercher ici des résultats irréfutables. Toutefois, il y a là une indication de la sensibilité de l'indice des prix à la consommation à de simples manipulations, et de la nécessité de clarifier la signification de différentes situations de changements de prix.},

	abstract = {We characterize inflation dynamics during the Great Lockdown using scanner data covering millions of transactions for fast-moving consumer goods in the United Kingdom. We show that there was a significant and widespread spike in inflation. First, aggregate month-to-month inflation was 2.4\% in the first month of lockdown, a rate over 10 times higher than in preceding months. Over half of this increase stems from reduced frequency of promotions. Consumers' purchasing power was further eroded by a reduction in product variety. Second, 96\% of households have experienced inflation in 2020, while in prior years around half of households experienced deflation. Third, there was inflation in most product categories, including those that experienced output falls. Only 13\% of product categories experienced deflation, compared with over half in previous years. While market-based measures of inflation expectations point to disinflation or deflation, these findings indicate a risk of stagflation should not be ruled out. We hope our approach can serve as a template to facilitate rapid diagnosis of inflation risks during economic crises, leveraging scanner data and appropriate price indices in real-time.,

We build a unique household-level panel dataset which combines wealth and consumption surveys for ﬁve European countries to estimate country-speciﬁc marginal propensity to consume out wealth. We use instrumented household-level panel regressions. First, we show that the MPC out of total wealth is higher for lowwealth households, whatever the country. Second, we ﬁnd that the MPC out of housing assets is signiﬁcant and decreasing along the wealth distribution in all countries. Third, we show that the observed cross-country heterogeneity in MPC is strongly correlated with the use of mortgages, suggesting a collateral channel. Finally, we conduct a simulation exercise to investigate to what extent heterogeneous MPC and wealth inequality affect consumption inequality.},

This heterogeneity accounts for approximately two-thirds of the overall inﬂation dispersion. It is larger on average for households with lower substitution elasticity, which are households that have an above-median income, that do not include retirees, that have a low number of household members and that tend to buy sticky-price goods. Furthermore, inﬂation dispersion varies over time, where periods with very stable aggregate rates of inﬂation are associated with less-dispersed inﬂation rates across households.},

We use survey data on household portfolios for the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to document the share of such households across countries, their demographic characteristics, the composition of their balance sheets, and the persistence of hand-to-mouth status over the life cycle. The portfolio configuration of the wealthy hand-to-mouth suggests that these households may have a high marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income changes, a prediction for which we find empirical support in PSID data. We explain the implications of this group of consumers for macroeconomic modeling and fiscal policy analysis.},

The median frequency of price change for finished-goods producer prices is comparable to that of consumer prices excluding sales. (2) One-third of nonsale price changes are price decreases. (3) The frequency of price increases covaries strongly with inflation, whereas the frequency of price decreases and the size of price increases and price decreases do not. (4) The frequency of price change is highly seasonal: it is highest in the first quarter and then declines. (5) We find no evidence of upwardsloping hazard functions of price changes for individual products. We show that the first, second, and third facts are consistent with a benchmark menu-cost model, whereas the fourth and fifth facts are not.},

They give rise to log-linear systems of estimable demand relations.

The index largely avoids the need for estimation, aggregates consistently across heterogeneous households, and admits diﬀerent index weights across the expenditure distribution. The latter property rationalizes the methods used in most previous measurements of inﬂation inequality. In an empirical application to the United States using CEX-CPI data for the period 1995–2020, we ﬁnd: (i) poor and rich households experience on average the same inﬂation rate; but (ii) inﬂation for the poorest decile is more than 2.5 times as volatile as that of the richest decile; and (iii) this higher volatility primarily stems from a larger exposure to price changes in food, gas and utilities. In these ﬁndings, substitution between goods as prices change plays only a second-order role. Instead, almost all diﬀerences come from mechanical changes in the cost of diﬀerent base-period reference baskets.},
