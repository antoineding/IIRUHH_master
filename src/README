.jl file: 

* Ben_Moll_code_egp_IID_aiyagari
Computes Aiyagari model with iid income risk via endogenous grid point, found on Benjamain Moll website

* discrete_nomal
Compute normal distribution for iid income risk

* linterp1
Interpolate saving value for intertemporal problem

* NH_EE
Compute partial equilibrium with non homothetic preferences with Euler equation interation

* NH_EGP
Compute partial equilibrium with non homothetic preferences with Endogenous grid point method interation before shock

* NH_EGP_shock
Compute partial equilibrium with non homothetic preferences with Endogenous grid point method  interation after shock

* NH_EGP_endo_price
Compute general equilibrium with non homothetic preferences withEndogenous grid point method interation with prices consistency


.ipynb file:

* Endow_treatingexcess
Endowment model served to compute supply shock on primary goods with details

* Income_treatingexcess
Decentralized competitive equilibrum model served to compute supply shock on primary goods with details. Capital and labor level were given. Not the best so please refer to NH_EE, NH_EGP, NH_EGP_shock and NH_EGP_endo_price.
